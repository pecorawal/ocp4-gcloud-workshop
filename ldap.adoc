== LDAP Setting

First thing is to maintain an LDAP tree with 5 main groups. This should be:

* OCP Admin
* OCP Operations
* OCP Project Admin
* OCP Project Dev
* OCP Project Viewer

See sample image as follows:

=== Apply the Oauth CR

After adjust the LDAP Group tree on the underlying infrastructure, you must create the 
Patching image registry tolerations and node selector.

[source]
----
oc patch config/cluster -n openshift-image-registry --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"nodeSelector": {"node-role.kubernetes.io/infra": ""},"tolerations": [{"effect":"NoSchedule","key": "infra","value": "reserved"},{"effect":"NoExecute","key": "infra","value": "reserved"}]}}'
----


=== Set registry storage to use ephemeral volume

[source]
----
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"storage":{"emptyDir":{}}}}'
----

NOTE: In production environments set the registry storage with some supported persistent storage such as OCS or NFS.
