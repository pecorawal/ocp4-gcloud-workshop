# Workshop Hands-on - Deploy OCP 4.x on Google Cloud

### Prerequisites Preparation

IMPORTANT: To accomplish Red Hat Openshift Container Platform, you must have a non-free credits subscription on Google Cloud to properly create and configure the steps below.

The first thing on Google Cloud Platform is to create a new project. As soon as you created the project, go to your Dashboard and take a note of project name and project id. These values will be used in a future. A sample below demonstrates how to accomplish it.

=== Download your Gcloud Sdk

Next, you need to download gcloud sdk, go to  https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-macos?authuser=2 and choose the OS that properly fits you. Follow the installation steps on the site.

You can find a list of another SDK types which best fit on your machine on: link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-versioned-archives[]


=== Initialize the sdk

Extract files from tar.gz and run inside sdk directory:

[source]
----
./install.sh #Follow the on screen instructions
----

After finished the installer to initialize the sdk, you must first update all components under the gcloud installation directory

[source]
----
gcloud components update 
----

[source]
----
gcloud init --console-only

See the output sample 

Welcome! This command will take you through the configuration of gcloud.

Your current configuration has been set to: [default]

You can skip diagnostics next time by using the following flag:
  gcloud init --skip-diagnostics

Network diagnostic detects and fixes local network connection issues.
Checking network connection...done.
Reachability Check passed.
Network diagnostic passed (1/1 checks passed).

You must log in to continue. Would you like to log in (Y/n)?  Y # <1> 

Go to the following link in your browser: # <2>

    https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?code_challenge=daksdaldajksdjaklandkakasdasdA%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fcloud-platform+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fappengine.admin+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fcompute+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Faccounts.reauth


Enter verification code: 4/xwFLeky-AFVVtg2DI5AyvGcE3-E1-6DfEDgHMFzwhNOLfenKFOfQkb4
You are logged in as: [anonymous@gmail.com].

Pick cloud project to use: <3>
 [1] hybrid-ridge-271915
 [2] Create a new project
Please enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match list
item):  1

Your current project has been set to: [hybrid-ridge-271915].

Not setting default zone/region (this feature makes it easier to use
[gcloud compute] by setting an appropriate default value for the
--zone and --region flag).
See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute section on how to set
default compute region and zone manually. If you would like [gcloud init] to be
able to do this for you the next time you run it, make sure the
Compute Engine API is enabled for your project on the
https://console.developers.google.com/apis page.

Created a default .boto configuration file at [/Users/rpecora/.boto]. See this file and
[https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/config] for more
information about configuring Google Cloud Storage.
Your Google Cloud SDK is configured and ready to use!

* Commands that require authentication will use rvspecora@gmail.com by default
* Commands will reference project `hybrid-ridge-271915` by default
Run `gcloud help config` to learn how to change individual settings

This gcloud configuration is called [default]. You can create additional configurations if you work with multiple accounts and/or projects.
Run `gcloud topic configurations` to learn more.

Some things to try next:

* Run `gcloud --help` to see the Cloud Platform services you can interact with. And run `gcloud help COMMAND` to get help on any gcloud command.
* Run `gcloud topic --help` to learn about advanced features of the SDK like arg files and output formatting

----
1. In this step, you must insert (Y) and the Google Credentials popup will appears, use your Google Cloud Credentials
2. After login process is completed it will show an authorization link, just click and follow the screen steps
2. You can opt-in to the project previously created to set as default to all next gcloud commands.
 


=== Enabling Required Ocp 4 Services

After create a profile of your default project, region and zone, you must enable proper services in order the IPI must be able to use Gcloud APIs.

[source]
----
gcloud config set project hybrid-ridge-271915
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudapis.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable dns.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iamcredentials.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable servicemanagement.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable serviceusage.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage-api.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage-component.googleapis.com
----


=== Creating a Service account and Add an Identity Policy 

IPI will use this service accounts to create and destroy objects to be used to Openshift 4.

[source]
----
gcloud iam service-accounts create ocp4-sa --description "Service Account OCP 4" --display-name "OCP Service Account"

Created service account [ocp4-sa].
----

After enabling services and create service account you must give the permission to service account.

[source]
----
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding hybrid-ridge-271915 --member serviceAccount:ocp4-sa@hybrid-ridge-271915.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/owner

Updated IAM policy for project [hybrid-ridge-271915].
bindings:
- members:
  - serviceAccount:service-952705263978@compute-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/compute.serviceAgent
- members:
  - serviceAccount:952705263978-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
  - serviceAccount:952705263978@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/editor
- members:
  - serviceAccount:ocp4-sa@hybrid-ridge-271915.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  - user:ommitted@gmail.com
  role: roles/owner
etag: BwWhs5VtlJs=
version: 1
----


=== Create a Private Key Associated to a Service Account

On the previous step, we create a service account and grant permission to be used as credentials between IPI installer, Google Cloud API and future Openshift cluster functions.

Start listing the current service account keys and identify the key created at previous step.

[source]
----
gcloud iam service-accounts list

NAME                                    EMAIL                                                DISABLED
Compute Engine default service account  952705263978-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com   False
OCP Service Account                     ocp4-sa@hybrid-ridge-271915.iam.gserviceaccount.com  False
----

Create a json file private key to be used during installation

[source]
----
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ocp4-key-ybrid-ridge-271915 --key-file-type json --iam-account ocp4-sa@hybrid-ridge-271915.iam.gserviceaccount.com

created key [fc2e957ae308b57e566fd68871c602ad440e435a] of type [json] as [ocp4-key-ybrid-ridge-271915] for [ocp4-sa@hybrid-ridge-271915.iam.gserviceaccount.com]
----

IMPORTANT:  At the previous step, the file named ocp4-key-ybrid-ridge-271915 is the one that you will be asked to path on the openshift-install installer. Keep this file under a directory that you have all inputs to OCP 4.



=== Create a DNS Zone and delegate the NS to your DNS provider


This is an important part of process and can cause a confusion during creation and DNS provider setup.
You should create a subdomain zone of your main dns zone in order to delegate the Google Cloud DNS only the dns to openshift objects and not all parent DNS records.

To make feasible, lets check the example:
I have a DNS zone domain at Godaddy which calls "pec-labs.site" and I need I subdomain of this site named newgoogle.pec-labs.site. 
We must create the subdomain at Gcloud as follows:

[source]
----
gcloud dns managed-zones create newgoogle --description="OCP4 subdomain at Google Cloud" --dns-name=newgoogle.pec-labs.site                                      
Created [https://dns.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/hybrid-ridge-271915/managedZones/newgoogle].
----

Now, check the subdomain created and get the nameservers which we will use under our DNS provider (Godaddy, in this case). 

[source]
----
gcloud dns managed-zones describe newgoogle
creationTime: '2020-03-25T20:56:39.968Z'
description: OCP4 subdomain at Google Cloud
dnsName: newgoogle.pec-labs.site.
id: '4911304450872339170'
kind: dns#managedZone
name: newgoogle
nameServers:
- ns-cloud-c1.googledomains.com.
- ns-cloud-c2.googledomains.com.
- ns-cloud-c3.googledomains.com.
- ns-cloud-c4.googledomains.com.
visibility: public
----
TIP: Don't copy the dot punctuation at the end of nameserver records.

=== Open your external DNS zone and delegate cluster DNS subdomain.

The parent domain must have DNS Zone records as described on previous output:
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pecorawal/images/master/dns-godaddy2.png[]

Check if dns zone records are correctly answering.

=== Download OCP client and installer and Prepare an install-config.yaml

#### Download install bin
Download the Openshift Installer, Secret and Command-line interface to the installation directory under your computer.
[source]
----
OCP4_BASEURL=https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest
LATEST_VERSION=$(curl -s ${OCP4_BASEURL}/release.txt | grep 'Version: ' | awk '{print $2}')
OS=mac #put linux if you are running under a Linux OS client 
curl -s ${OCP4_BASEURL}/openshift-client-${OS}-$LATEST_VERSION.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /usr/local/bin oc kubectl
curl -s ${OCP4_BASEURL}/openshift-install-${OS}}-$LATEST_VERSION.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /usr/local/bin openshift-install
----

Next, you need to create a ssh-key to be used as ssh key pair to trigger the installation and automation on Red Hat CoreOs.

[source, yaml]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N '' -f ~/.ssh/gcloud-key
----

Keep the private and pub key in a safe place in case that you  need to do any troubleshooting on Red Hat Openshift Cluster
After setup all gcloud stuff it's now time to prepare a install-config.yaml, below is the sample with according previous steps.

#### Generating andm Store Pull Secret

Generate Pull Secret at https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/gcp/installer-provisioned Store it in ~/ocp4/bkp/ocp4_pull_secret


#### Create install file:

[source]
----
mkdir ~/ocp4 ~/ocp4/bkp ~/ocp4/install
cd ~/ocp4


export DOMAIN=pec-labs.site # <1>
export CLUSTERID=ocp4 # <2>
export PULL_SECRET=$(cat ~/ocp4/bkp/ocp4_pull_secret) # <3>
export OCP_SSH_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/gcloud-key.pub) # <4>
export GCP_PROJECTID=hybrid-ridge-271915 <5> 
export MASTER_FLAVOR=n1-standard-4 <6>
export WORKER_FLAVOR=n1-standard-2 <7>
export GCP_REGION=us-east-1 <8>
